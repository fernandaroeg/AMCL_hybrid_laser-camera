# ROS AMCL Hybrid Localization
This repository provides the code used and developped to test a hybrid localization algorithm in ROS based on the AMCL with data from a public dataset. This repository forms part of the master final project: "Evaluation of a Hybrid Localization Algorithm with aPublic DataSet of Indoor Environments" done to obtain the master in automation and robotics.
The public dataset used is: https://github.com/jotaraul/robot-at-home_meeting-point

# AMCL Hybrid
This project incorporates a detector node capable of processing natural rectangular marks in indoor environments to be treated as visual localization points to improve overall localization of indoor robots.
